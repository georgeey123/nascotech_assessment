## üèóÔ∏è Approach
1. **Fetching Data**: The app fetches country data from the REST Countries API and stores it in the component state.
2. **Search & Filtering**: Users can search for countries using the `SearchBar` component, which updates the URL query parameters.
3. **Sorting**: Users can sort countries by population using a dropdown.
4. **Navigation & Details**: Clicking on a country leads to a detail page that provides additional information.
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Using **Suspense** and **React hooks** ensures smooth data fetching and reactivity.
6. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling to make the UI clean and responsive.
